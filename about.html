        <p>Hi, welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Sarah Stupak and I am a junior at the University of Michigan's School of Information.
            My focus is in Data Science and Analytics where I am learning
        to gather essential data to answer questions in a creative and conving way.
        I am passionate about the intersection of business and technology in 
        order to  create digital solutions that improve lives. Three words
    that I would use to describe myself are hard-working, motivated, and coachable.</p>
        <p>A bit more about my background is that I am orginally from Ann Arbor, Michigan, but I 
        now live in New Jersey. I have lived in four different states, including Michigan, California, 
        New York, and New Jersey. By moving, I was able to gain a unique perspective on what 
        it is like to be in different parts of the country. Often I get asked the question,
        "What was your favorite place to live?" I do not have a favorite place as they are 
        all so different in the best way possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, I am involved in many different organizations on my campus, which 
          you will be able to access on my Extracurriculars page. In addition, I have had work 
          experience in a few different industries, which has given me the opportunity 
          to apply my skillset in multiple situations. Outside of school, I enjoy various activities, 
          which you will be able to see on the Fun page. Thank you for browsing my portfolio!
        </p>
