      <h3>Phi Beta Lambda</h3>
      <p>
        At the University of Michigan, I have been involved in 
        many different clubs. I am extremely active in my business
        fraternity, which is Phi Beta Lambda (PBL). In PBL, 
        I have held an officer position where I was Philanthropy Chair.
        As Philanthropy Chair, I organzied events to get the 
        brotherhood more involved. I implemented new fundraisers by building 
        connections with new charities and planned events that 
        the bortherhood would enjoy, elicting the biggest positive impact. 
        I networked for future endeavors by participating in weekly 
        professional events and projects that highlighted the 
        technology, finance, consulting, and marketing industries. 
        I managed a stock portfolio during an investment competition on Investopedia stock stimulator.

      <h3>Challah for Hunger</h3>
      <p>
        Challah for Hunger created the Campus Hunger Project Cohort, which is a 
        national leadership program for students to design and implement projects that engage their peers and communities. 
        This was implemented because at least 3 million 
        college students are food insecure. In my local chapter, I executed the social media presence to promote events where the proceeds raised go to Food Gatherers.
        I educated volunteers about food insecurity on college campuses and ways to help at U-M.
        I devised new events that would rebuild and expand volunteer participation.

      <h3>Go Blue Wear Pink</h3>
        <p>
          Go Blue Wear Pink is a student-run organization at the University of 
          Michigan that raises money to fund breast cancer research at the U-M Rogel 
          Cancer Center. Since 2007, students have raised over $360,000 to accelerate 
          groundbreaking research at one of the nationâ€™s leading cancer research centers. We all know 
          someone who has been affected by cancer, whether a close friend, family member, 
          or friend of a friend. And we have all seen the debilitating effect that this 
          disease can have on patients and the people who are supporting them.Please 
          join us in easing the burden of cancer by making a donation. 
          Your support will improve and save lives. No donation is too small, 
          because every dollar represents the next step in the search for a cure. 
          I connected with companies for sponsorship and arranged social media 
          outreach to raise over $48,000 for breast cancer research at the U-M Rogel Cancer Center.
