        I have had a few internships over the past few years. These internships have spanned 
        over multiple industries including legal services, financial services, and emergency services. 
        These experiences have enabled me to work with a variety of people who have shaped me into 
        a student and person that is able to communicate and empathize with others. I was able to gain
        skills at these internships that will be applicable to future work experiences.

      <h3>Cole, Scott & Kissane</h3>
      <h4>--Summer Analyst--</h4>
      <p>
        As a Summer Analyst, I leveraged technology to 
        create documents and demonstrative aids to be 
        referenced in court that made the evidence easier 
        for analysis by the jury. I correlated data from 
        similar civil cases that evaluated the 
        documentation and legal materials needed to 
        aid the lawyers in trial, leading to firm wide 
        wins. I analyzed large legal documents and legal 
        proceedings for usable information, which 
        identified the implications of cases that can be 
        used in making a compelling argument.

      <h3>Pendulum Capital Management</h3>
      <h4>--Financial Analyst Summer Intern--</h4>
      <p>
        As a Summer Financial Analyst, I compiled and 
        presented data on investment opportunities and 
        delivered them directly to associates to create 
        more streamlined operations throughout the firm. I 
        composed comprehensive analytical reports each 
        week summarizing investments based on stock price, 
        quarterly earnings, and qualitative features to assess how 
        much money the fund should invest. I presented 
        conclusions based on quantitative data to the 
        firm at the end of each day, resulting in 
        discussions about the risk of the investment.

      <h3>Woodcliff Lake Fire Department</h3>
      <h4>--Volunteer Firefighter--</h4>
      
      <p>
        As a Volunteer Firefighter, I participated in weekly 
        training ranging from vehicle extractions, 
        F.A.S.T. rescue board, and to operation of the tower 
        ladder from the truckâ€™s bucket. I assessed the 
        severity of a situation when reacting to emergency 
        calls and determined the proper response. I 
        communicated with 10 firefighters, distributing 
        tasks in a high pressure environment to reinforce 
        teamwork.
